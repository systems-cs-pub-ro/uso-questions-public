Working on your first Pull Request?
You can learn how from the free series [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://app.egghead.io/playlists/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).

## Contributing Steps

Preparatory phases:

1. Create a fork of this repository.
1. Clone your fork locally or update your local clone with the upstream repository updates.

Adding new questions:

1. Think of a nice and interesting question (or more) you want to add as a contribution.
1. Create a new branch for the new question(s).
1. Locate the file(s) where the question(s) will be added, based on question(s) topic.
1. Use the [human-readable format](#question-format) to develop a new question in the appropriate file.
   You can start from the [`template.hr`](template.hr) file.
   See sample questions in [`sample.hr`](sample.hr).
1. Commit changes to your branch.
1. Push changes to your fork.
1. Create a pull request (PR).
1. Answer to requests from the reviewer on the PR.
1. Once the reviewer approves the PR, your contribution will be integrated.

## Question Format

We use a custom format (named *human-readable format*, or *hr*) to easily create new questions.
The format is documented in the [Quiz Manager repository](https://github.com/systems-cs-pub-ro/quiz-manager/blob/master/README.md#question-format).

Topics for USO questions are listed in the [`topics.txt`](topics.txt) file:

* `admin`: administration-related questions, usually related to services and system configuration
* `app_dev`: application development, build automation, build phases, development tools
* `basic`: basic / common sense questions on operating systems and Linux
* `boot`: bootstrapping, bootloaders, the boot process
* `cli`: using the shell, shell operators, one liners
* `data`: data storage and processing
* `embedded`: embedded systems
* `file_system`: file operations, filesystem hierarchy
* `general`: question covering multiple topics
* `hardware`: hardware, drivers, physical computing resources
* `netiquette`: Internet etiquette guideliness
* `networking`: network configuration, network parameters, Internet, Internet services
* `process`: working with processes, process inspection, process hierarchy
* `regex`: regular expressions
* `security`: data protection, data integrity, encryption, password management
* `shell_scripting`: shell scripting, automation
* `user`: users, groups, user management, access control, filesystem permissions
* `vm`: virtual machines, containers

Choose one topic per question.
For questions with tuples (i.e. `Which of the following matches the (security, filesytem, networking) tuple`), use the `general` topic.

For difficulty use a numeric value between `1` and `3`, as shown in the [`difficulty.txt`](difficulty.txt) file.

USO questions may fall under one of the categories:

* questions with 4 answers in total, 1 correct answer
* questions with 5 answers in total, 2 correct answers
* questions with 7 answers in total, 3 correct answers

## Style Guides

### Git Commit Guidelines

* Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature").
* Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...").
* Prefix each question commit message with the topic name.
* Limit the first line to 72 characters or less.
* Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line.
